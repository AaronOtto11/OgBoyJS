# OgBoyJS
Learning JS and emulator development in the same project


## Concept
This project aims to create a functional GameBoy emulator in JavaScript. While this has been done before, this is more of a learning exercise. 

JS is a fully capable OOP language and because of that I want to encapsulate as much of the processes as possible. This may not be the most computationally efficent way to achieve these results but dividing and conquering is my prefered solution to large Epics such as emulation.
